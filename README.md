# What is Dracul Code Editor?
<p>Dracul Code Editor is a CSharp based code editor for dot net programmers. The code editor is so light weight that code work also on little old systems. The code editor also aims to teach people the CSharp programming language. To do that I will be adding new features as built in codes with teaching tutorils to the code editor as well as on my YouTube channel.</p>

# Features
* Light weight.
* User friendly.
* Beginner friendly.
  * With next version I am aiming to teach people who started learning CSharp programming language.
  * With the next version, there will be built-in codes for beginners to look at and learn from. These pre-installed codes are also going to be able to be used by others to save time.
* CSharp compatible code editor.
* Development support.

# What were the challanges?
* I took an error message while I was connecting to my Database on cPanel. (Took me 3-4 hours to figure out).
  * Solved the problem and wrote a Medium Page about it.
